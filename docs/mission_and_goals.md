# Mission and Goals
Cardinal Planner has a number of different missions and goals, which are outlined in this document.

## Mission
Our mission is to empower students to plan out their time to achieve their goals in a fulfilling way.

## Central Goal
Our **central goal** is to create the best way (by far) for students to plan their long term and short term schedules.

This goal is the entire purpose of Cardinal Planner, and everything we do as a team should be working toward that goal. If we can achieve this goal, then things like number of users, % of Stanford students who use our site, and potentially commercial applications will come easily. At the same time, it will be very difficult to succeed without achieving our central goal.

For a list of specific goals and specific deadlines, take a look at our `product_roadmap.md` document.

## Specific Goals

### Learn
Another important purpose of Cardinal Planner is to learn how to work in a startup-like environment. Sure, we're not working 16 hour days and we're not backed by VC firms, but we are working with a talented and driven team on a large software project with real users, real deadlines, and the possibility of commercial success. This is possibly as close as you can get to being in a startup without actually being in one.

### Fun
It can be immensely rewarding to see your work in the hands of users. Once Cardinal Planner is used by the majority of Stanford students (clearly only a matter of time), your work will directly affect thousands of people planning out their academic careers. Creating a new feature or fixing an issue with our service could brighten the day of many of your peers when they use it.
