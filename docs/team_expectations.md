# Team Expectations

While Cardinal Planner is an extracurricular project that depends on what is effectively volunteer work, working on a group project like this is akin to a team sport: it requires a talented and committed group of people who are willing to make the necessary time to go to meetings and get work done.

To that end, in order to join & remain on the team, you must do the following:

### Attend the weekly team meeting (ON TIME)

The team meeting is crucial to attend, since that is when we discuss the direction & plans of Cardinal Planner as well as assign tasks for the week.  We will change this team meeting from Friday to the meeting that works best for everyone.

This is the one meeting that you must be on time to, because we actually discuss things as a group.  Try to get there within five minutes of the start of the meeting.  If you're more than fifteen minutes late, your attendance won't be counted.

### Attend at least one of the three work sessions each week

We have one team meeting and three work sessions each week.  While we hope that you can attend all four weekly meetings, the baseline expectation is that you attend the team meeting and at least ONE work session each week.  One work session will usually be insufficient to finish your weekly tasks, so you will probably want to either attend more sessions or work from home.

### Finish your tasks on time

Each team meeting, we will assign you tasks that you are expected to ship by the next team meeting.  It is your responsibility to ensure that you are assigned a reasonable workload and it is your responsibility to finish all of your assigned tasks on time.

## Missing Expectations

We understand that you might have an extra tough week where you can't commit as much time to Cardinal Planner.  This is fine as long as you compensate for time you missed and don't make it a habit.  Missing some meetings and deadlines during midterms, dead week, and finals is ok but habitually missing meetings and deadlines because of regular homework or other extracurriculars is not acceptable and is grounds for removal from the team.  Yes, it's harsh, but we need to have a group of committed team members that can make the necessary time for Cardinal Planner.
