# Agenda for Team Meetings

This is an outline what to discuss for weekly team meetings. Basically, it's a team meeting, standup, and sprint planning meeting all combined into one meeting.

## 1. How Cardinal Planner is doing

Quick presentation on key metrics and vanity metrics to give everyone a sense of the state of Cardinal Planner.

## 2. How we're doing

Each team member talks about:

- What they worked on during the week, possibly does a demo if they want.
- Speaks generally about how the week went & suggests points of improvement if applicable.

## 3. Task Planning

We plan out which tasks to attempt to complete in the next week and assign them to specific people.
